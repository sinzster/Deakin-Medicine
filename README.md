# Deakin-Medicine
An Anki Deck for the Deakin Medical Program

Hello Everyone. This is Abhishek here, and I am hoping to create an Anki deck that 1st year Deakin Medical students can use. The aim is to reduce the number of cards that every one of us has to create so that we can all leverage technology and each other's efforts to benefit ourselves.

I am still playing it by ear right now, but if you are interested, please feel free to contribute, and please let me know if you have any new ideas.

Cheers,
Abhishek Nage
